Robotics with Transformers 


Collection of ideas to try/implement
1. Using checkerboard snapshot to get real-world coordinates. Note x.y,z of the arm. Get to that arm position, then get world coordinates of objects
2. Also identify first how robotic arm moves. It should move while its looking. That should be the angle for world coordinate.
3. Angle of camera is not needed because world coordinate can be obtained at #2
